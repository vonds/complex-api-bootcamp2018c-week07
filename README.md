mangoMusicDB Project


For this project I used the itune's api and TheAudioDB's api. This application allows you to search an artist's name and retrieve their discography from itunes. The user can click the buy me section and go direclty to itunes to purchase the album. If the user selects the artist info button a bio, including a picture of the artist, and a link to their official website appears.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, es6 JS, OOP

I experimented with IIFE, OOP, and making a XMHLHttp and fetch request for this project. 

Optimizations (in the future): 
-Try using promises instead.
-Better utilize methods in my objects



Lessons Learned:
XMLHttp requests
Making sure I'm taking into consideration the design of my code
